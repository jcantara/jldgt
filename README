This is intended to be a relatively lightweight "framework" AKA template for creating games with SDL and OpenGL in C++

Its purpose is to provide the basics in order to compete in the LudumDare 48-hour game-programming competitions, though should be useful outside of that arena as well. 

There is no license, there's no guarantees or anything with this software, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I'm a beginner at C++, but trying to organize this in a logical way at least; but the code here may be dumb. I make no representations as to the quality of the software found here.
